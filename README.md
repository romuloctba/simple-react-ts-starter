## Simple React Ts Starter

I use this repo as base for simple static-file ReactJs projects, usually SPA's, without routing.

---

### How to Use:

1. `$ npm install`

2. `$ npm start` runs webpack dev server on localhost:3000

3. `$ npm build` generates the static files

---

### Contains:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass)
- [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/)
- [The New Reset](https://github.com/elad2412/the-new-css-reset)

### Why?
> To use CRA or NextJS sometimes just feels like too much.
